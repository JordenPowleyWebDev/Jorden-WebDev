                <p class="dark_blue_text">I'm Jorden Powley. A web developer currently based in the Midlands area. Let's talk about me before I go full work on this.</p>
                <p class="dark_blue_text">Like everyone else most of my time is spent at work... or going to work... or coming home from work... However when I'm not doing either of those, I'm usually doing something else. Except learning proper sentence structure.</p>
                <p class="dark_blue_text">I go running and to the gym regularly, I'm compulsively clean and 80% of my waking time I'm listening to music. House, Grime, Classical, Jazz. Quite eclectic. I currently spend some of my time recreationally coding. Usually on my own project, some of which I complete after competing with my own high standards.</p>
                <p class="dark_blue_text">As a footnote I've been told I can organise a monster of a pub crawl.</p>
