            <p class="white_text">Currently I work for Zonal Marketing Technologies as an agency member. Being a member of an agency I have become used to dealing with fast turnaround of work and the high volume of work. </p>
            <p class="white_text">Projects I've worked on have been vastly varying in scale. Most of these project I write in PHP, smaller project usually are in a procedural architecture, larger projects in an OOP architecture. I try to write most of my code in an easy to read componentised manner, so that I can rip elements out when I need them later.</p>
            <p class="white_text">Part of my frontend job is to build marketing emails. This sounds easy. Nope. A regular web developer will only have to build for standardized browsers. Email clients, not to name any (Outlook, Gmail), don't like to follow web standards forcing us to follow conventions from yesteryear.</p>
            <p class="white_text">My current drive with work is pushing for different PHP frameworks. Currently I like CodeIgnitor but I'm focusing on Laravel. I'm always looking for something new to learn, even if I don't quite have the time.</p>
